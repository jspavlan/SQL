Subject: Stroke Data Analysis Report: Insights on Hypertension, Glucose Levels, and Stroke Risk Demographics

Dear Manager,

I hope this message finds you well. Below is the summary of the analysis based on the stroke prediction dataset, 
highlighting key insights around hypertension, glucose levels, BMI, and high-risk demographics.

1. Average Age of Stroke Patients by Gender

Objective: To compare the average age of stroke patients by gender.

Key Findings:

    Female patients: 67.14 years
    Male patients: 68.50 years

Insight:
On average, male stroke patients are older than female stroke patients. 
This suggests that men may experience stroke later in life, possibly requiring different preventive strategies. 
This insight can inform targeted interventions based on gender and age.

2. Average Glucose Level by Gender

Objective: To compare the average glucose levels between male and female stroke patients.

Key Findings:

    Female stroke patients: 132.54 mg/dL
    Male stroke patients: 104.80 mg/dL

Insight:
Female stroke patients have significantly higher average glucose levels compared to their male counterparts. 
This indicates that glucose management might be particularly important for female stroke patients, 
pointing to the need for gender-specific stroke prevention strategies.

3. Number of Hypertensive Stroke Patients

Objective: To identify how many stroke patients also have hypertension.

Key Findings:

    66 patients with hypertension also experienced a stroke.

Insight:
Hypertension is strongly correlated with stroke risk. This highlights the importance of addressing hypertension as part of
stroke prevention, emphasizing early interventions for hypertensive patients.

4. Average BMI by Smoking Status

Objective: To compare the average BMI for stroke patients based on smoking status.

Key Findings:

    Unknown smoking status: 24.65
    Formerly smoked: 29.08
    Never smoked: 29.35
    Smokes: 28.53

Insight:
Patients who have never smoked and those who formerly smoked show similar and elevated BMI levels. 
This suggests that while smoking cessation may reduce stroke risk, elevated BMI remains a significant concern,
particularly in former smokers. Healthcare interventions should focus 
on weight management alongside smoking cessation programs.

5. Highest-Risk Demographic for Stroke Based on Age, Hypertension, and Smoking Status

Objective: To identify the highest-risk demographic for stroke by analyzing age, hypertension, and smoking status.

Key Findings:

    The highest-risk demographic includes individuals aged 78-80, with hypertension, and varying smoking statuses:
        Never smoked: 4 cases (80 years old)
        Formerly smoked: 3 cases (78 years old)
        Smokes: 2 cases (61 years old)

Insight:
Elderly patients with hypertension are at the highest risk for stroke, regardless of their smoking history. 
However, the 80-year-old age group with hypertension and no smoking history stands out as particularly vulnerable. 
This suggests that healthcare systems should prioritize stroke prevention in hypertensive patients aged 75 and above, 
regardless of their smoking habits.

Please let me know if further analysis is needed or if you have any questions regarding these insights.

Best regards,
John P.
