1. Data Cleaning: Handling Mismatched A/B Test Data

DELETE FROM ab_data
WHERE ([group] = 'control' AND landing_page != 'old_page') 
   OR ([group] = 'treatment' AND landing_page != 'new_page');

2. Calculate Conversion Rates by Group

SELECT 
    [group], 
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN CAST(converted AS INTEGER) = 1 THEN 1 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 4) AS conversion_rate
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY [group];


Results:
Group	Conversion Rate
control	0.1204
treatment	0.1188

Insight:

The conversion rates are similar, with the control group at 0.1204 and the treatment group at 0.1188. 
The minimal difference suggests no immediate effect from the treatment.
Next, weâ€™ll assess statistical significance to confirm whether this difference is meaningful.

3. Statistical Testing: Hypothesis Test to Check for Significance

-- We will perform a Chi-Square test to determine if the conversion rate difference is statistically significant
-- First, we calculate the observed values (number of conversions and non-conversions) for each group

SELECT 
    group,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN converted = 1 THEN 1 END) AS conversions,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN converted = 0 THEN 1 END) AS non_conversions
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY group;

RESULTS:

group      conversions  non conversions
control	   17489	       127785
treatment	 17264	     128049

4. Calculate Conversion Rates

-- Calculate conversion rate for each group
SELECT 
    [group],
    (SUM(CASE WHEN converted = '1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0) / COUNT(*) AS conversion_rate
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY [group];

RESULTS:

group       conversion rate
control	    0.12038630450046
treatment	  0.11880561271187
